### This is my Personal Portal for Data Science Projects which was done under "MS is Data Science" from Bellevue University

[Project 1 :: Retail - Market Analytics on Holiday Trend](https://github.com/rahulgupta271/DSC680_Project_1_Market_analytics_holiday_trend/blob/master/README.md)

#### The method by which analytical data is generated and analyzed is Retail Data analysis. This information can be used to report on different facets of the supply chain operation in the retail chain, including purchases, returns, discounts, and more.

[Project 2 :: Financial - Analysis on Customer Retention](https://github.com/rahulgupta271/DSC680_Project_2_Financial_Analysis_Customer_data/blob/main/README.md)

#### The business objective of this project is to analyze the success rate in customer retention through direct campaign marketing by a Portuguese Bank for which this data set pertains to

[Project 3 :: Manufacture - Enterprise Asset Maintenance](https://github.com/rahulgupta271/DSC680_Project_3_Enterprise_Asset_Maintenance/blob/main/README.md)

#### For this Project, I am applying a predictive maintenance model, using an example case where the aim is to anticipate faults due to some system components. The analysis includes feature engineering, feature selection, labeling, training and evaluation of this predictive model. Predictive models are built with Python packages.

[Project 4 :: Model Evaluation - Cross Validation](https://github.com/rahulgupta271/rahulgupta271.github.io/blob/master/Model%20Evaluation%20-%20Cross%20Validation/README.md)

#### Create text classification models using logistic regression & Naive Bayes and evaluate the performance of those models through Cross Validation and Parameter Tuning to select the best model.

[Project 9 :: LA Bike Share - Operational Analytics & Demand Prediction](https://github.com/rahulgupta271/rahulgupta271.github.io/blob/master/BikeShare/README.md)

#### Usage rate of bikes, for a given station, on a given day and hour. This helps to figure out the number of bikes that should be in stock to handle the demand of the riders.

[Project 10 :: Topic Modelling - Pipeline Implementation](https://github.com/rahulgupta271/rahulgupta271.github.io/blob/master/TopicModeling/README.md)

####  I tried to implement end to end pipeline operations with various workflows for preprocessing the data, building models and using the built model to perform topic modelling.
